# SQL-Challenge

For this homework, we were asked to import 7 tables from a company with employee records using SQL, and then analyze the data with some simple queries. The first step was to make a schema, so when the tables get imported, SQL knows what structure they should have. The tables imported consisted of the following data:

*Departments
*Department and Employees
*Department and Managers
*Employees
*Salaries
*Titles

After analyzing the data to be imported, we wanted to visualize how the data would be organized, so we were asked to use [QuickDB Diagrams](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/8e2Z6R) to make an ERD of our table schema. I have linked the QuickDB Diagrams website for a better look at how I made my ERD. I have also included the screenshot of it below for quick reference:
