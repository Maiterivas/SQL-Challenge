# SQL-Challenge

For this homework, we were asked to import 7 tables from a company with employee records using SQL, and then analyze the data with some simple queries. The first step was to make a schema, so when the tables get imported, SQL knows what structure they should have. The tables imported consisted of the following data:

* Departments

* Department and Employees

* Department and Managers

* Employees

* Salaries

* Titles

After analyzing the data to be imported, we wanted to visualize how the data would be organized, so we were asked to use [QuickDB Diagrams](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/8e2Z6R) to make an ERD of our table schema. I have linked the QuickDB Diagrams website for a better look at how I made [my ERD]("EmployeeSQL/Employee_Tables_Schema.sql"). I have also included the screenshot of it below for quick reference:

After making my ERD, then I had to make my official schema in SQL, defining the table names, values and type of values, foreign keys, and primary keys for each table. The code for the table creation can be found [here]("EmployeeSQL/Employee_DB_Creation.sql").
